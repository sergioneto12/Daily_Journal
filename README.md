That's an EJS Challenge that I worked the last few days ago, using some things like EJS template, body parser, node.js express, lodash and css to get the required styles.

The project from udemy course "The complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" worked forcing the students to get things done without help,
even though it had a hin section and the resolution parts.

Really funny and easy to enjoy!
